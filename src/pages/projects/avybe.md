Avybe was a video streaming social media platform, similar to YouTube or TikTok. Unfortunatly it no longer exists and I also forgot to take any recordings of my work at the time. But if you'd like to learn more about the project please visit the [LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/avybe/). Or feel free to <RouterLink to="/contact">contact me directly</RouterLink>.
