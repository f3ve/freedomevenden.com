Hey, I'm Freedom. Thanks for checking out my little corner of the internet. I'm a programmer, currently working at [OBSKUR](https://obskur.com). I'm starting to dip my toes into the open-source community. I recently launched my first [NPM module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@f3ve/vue-markdown-it) and I've got some other ideas in the works.

Outside of programming I'm a dad, a gym-goer, and an avid gamer.

If you want to connect with me, reach out from the <router-link to="/contact" >contact form</router-link> or feel free to follow me on social media.

If you're interested in supporting me and my work please consider [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/f3ve) or [sponsoring me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/f3ve).
