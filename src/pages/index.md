Hey, I'm Freedom. Thanks for checking out my little corner of the internet. I'm a programmer currently working at [OBSKUR](https://obskur.com). I'm starting to dip my toes into the open source community. I recently launched my first [NPM module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@f3ve/vue-markdown-it) and I've got some other ideas in the works.

Outside of programming I'm a dad, a gym-goer, and an avid gamer. I'm currently playing [Starfield](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1716740/Starfield/)
