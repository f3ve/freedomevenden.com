## What's Changed

If you're a returning user you'll notice I've redesigned my website. If you're a new visitor, welcome!

It's been a long time since I did much with my website. In the time that's passed a lot has happened.

1. I moved out of my home state and then I moved back.
1. I got a new job as a Frontend Web Developer at [OBSKUR](https://obskur.com).
1. I became a home owner.
1. I became a father.

Needless to say, it's been a very eventful couple of years. There's been some ups and downs, but mostly ups. I've learned a lot about myself and what I want out of life.

When life is busy you eventually end up neglecting some things. For me one of those things was my website. <router-link to="/blog/how-to-create-custom-video-controls-in-react-native">My last post</router-link> was almost three years ago. My skill as a programmer, and a writer has grown so much since then. As a result I felt that my website no longer represented who I am.

Originally, I'd built it with the goal of getting a job and to learn. As a result I spent a lot of time worrying about making it look more "professional" and it ended up just stressing me out and not being fun to build. My blog posts felt stale and uninspired because I only wanted to write about things that sounded "professional".

Since then I've become much more confident in myself and my abilities. I no longer feel the need to make the "perfect" professional website. Instead this will just be a place for me to share my thoughts, tidbits about my life, and things I like with anyone who cares to see.

## The Process

So what exactly am I doing differently this time? Well for starters I've built this website using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
