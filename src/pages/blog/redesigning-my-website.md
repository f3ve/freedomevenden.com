## What's Changed

If you're a returning user you probably notice I redesigned my website. If you're a new visitor, welcome!

It's been a long time since I did much with my website. In the time that's passed a lot has happened.

1. I moved out of my home state and then I moved back.
1. I got a new job as a Frontend Web Developer at [OBSKUR](https://obskur.com).
1. I became a home owner.
1. I became a father.

Needless to say, it's been a very eventful couple of years. There's been some ups and downs, but mostly ups. I've learned a lot about myself and what I want out of life.

When life is busy, you eventually end up neglecting some things. For me, one of those things was my website. My last post was almost three years ago. My skill as a programmer, and a writer has grown significantly since then. As a result, I felt that my website no longer represented me, not that it ever really did.

Originally, I'd built it with the goal of getting a job. I spent a lot of time worrying about making it look more "professional" and it ended up just stressing me out and not being fun to build. My blog posts felt stale and uninspired because I only wanted to write about things that sounded "professional".

Since then I've become much more confident in myself and my abilities. I no longer feel the need to make the "perfect" professional website. Instead, this will just be a place for me to share my thoughts, tidbits about my life, and things I like with anyone who cares to see.

## The Tools I Used

So what exactly am I doing differently this time? For starters, I built this website using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). My original site was built using [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) which is a great framework, but I've been working professionally with Vue for some time and I've come to love it. Additionally, Vite has a great developer experience and has an astonishing amount of community-made plugins for just about anything you could think of. If you can't find a plugin for your specific needs, you can always [make one](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-plugin.html).

This time around I wanted to go with a text-based, minimalist design so I'm using a [Vite plugin](https://github.com/hmsk/vite-plugin-markdown) that allows me to create pages in Markdown. I like the idea of text-based websites because they perform well on old hardware and they're responsive by default. I want anyone to be able to access this site and have an enjoyable browsing experience without needing to wait for a bunch of assets to load.

For styling, I decided to use a tool called [UnoCSS](https://github.com/unocss/unocss). It's an on-demand atomic CSS engine. It's similar to [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). I decided to go with UnoCSS over Tailwind because it was more lightweight and was super easy to configure. It also has a handy [VSCode plugin](https://unocss.dev/integrations/vscode). Additionally, I'm not using any component libraries or CSS extensions. I wanted to avoid bloating the project with unnecessary tools. At the end of the day, this is a simple site, with simple goals and I want it to stay that way.

## The Goals

So, what are my goals for this website anyway? Well, I wanted to have my own little slice of the internet where I can share my thoughts, tidbits about my life, and a way for people to connect with me. But, I wanted to do that outside the control of major corporations like Twitter, Google, or Facebook. I wanted a place where I didn't need to worry about censorship or algorithms. By building my own site, I own it and everything on it. I don't need to worry about it being deleted or lost by something outside my control.

I've been inspired by the [indieweb movement](https://indieweb.org/) and the idea of the [small web](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/). I decided to act on it and make my own website to represent my ideals and be an outlet for creativity and personal expression.

I encourage you to try building your own website. It's easier than you think. Feel free to look through [this website's GitHub repo](https://github.com/f3ve/freedomevenden.com) for inspiration.
