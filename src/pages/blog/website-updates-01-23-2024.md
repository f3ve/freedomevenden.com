## What's Changed

1. Added a website search bar.
2. Added a wiki page.
   1. Will use this for general notes and informal posts.
   2. Not super happy with the collapsible link list yet. Will have to play around with it some more.
3. Added a uses page. 
   1. Inspired by [Christian Oliff](https://christianoliff.com/uses/).

## Future plans
I want to flesh out the wiki page some more and improve the functionality of the collapsible navigation list. I also want to get into a daily habit of writing. I'll be using the wiki for generally daily notes since it will be a bit more informal. It will also likely consist of pages that may be updated or change over time. In general blog posts will be treated a bit more formally and I'll avoid editing them except for typos or misspellings.
