Vue Notify is my latest web development project. It's a library that simplifies the process of displaying stacking status notifications to your users.

Since these kinds of notifications are often displayed after an asynchronous request it also includes a Vue composable that abstracts out the logic for running async code. Try out the demo below to see how it works and if you're interested in trying it out yourself head over to the [repo on Github](https://github.com/f3ve/vue-notify).
